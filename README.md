Drowsiness Detection Model
Description
The Drowsiness Detection Model is a machine learning application designed to determine whether individuals in a vehicle are asleep or awake. This model can detect multiple people in a single image or video, identify how many individuals are present, and specifically highlight those who are sleeping.

Features
Multiple Detection: The model can simultaneously analyze images or videos to detect and count the number of people.
Sleep Detection: It accurately identifies which individuals are asleep and marks them with a red bounding box.
Age Prediction: For those detected as sleeping, the model also predicts their age.
Pop-Up Notifications: Users will receive pop-up messages displaying the number of sleeping individuals and their predicted ages.
User-Friendly GUI: The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that supports both image and video input, providing a preview of the selected media.
Guidelines
Ensure the GUI is intuitive and allows users to easily upload images or videos.
The application should provide clear visual feedback, including the preview of the input and the detection results.
This project blends computer vision and machine learning techniques to enhance safety by monitoring driver drowsiness in real-time.
